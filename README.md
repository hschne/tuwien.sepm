The repository for the SEPM introduction exercise. 

## TODO:
- Fix a bug where receipt entries are not created upon adding a new receipt
- Write tests and clean that disgusting crap up.
- Bildrender implementieren (must do in data layer!)
- Create filters for article and receipts
- Create statistic stuff
- Create auto price change stuff
- Fix article sold bug (if article changed previous revisions will not count to sold articles)
- Clean up all files (dtos still used everywhere)
- give query builders a try (because manually building sql sucks)
