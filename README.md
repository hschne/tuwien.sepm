# SEPM
The repository for the SEPM introduction exercise. 

## TODO:
- JavaFX base setup
- Test remaining service classes (see test coverage!)
- Bildrender implementieren (must do in data layer!)
- Fix article sold bug (if article changed previous revisions will not count to sold articles)
- Diagramme... ugh
- give query builders a try (because manually building sql sucks)
